Known bugs:
1. when you move your mouse very rapidly undefined stuff happens
2. technically when countries have 0 medals this should be noted in the graph however it is hard to differentiate between not participating, no Medals and no data on said year
   id rather focus on practicing with javascript as i feel this was the main goal of the exercise
